## OO Principles
- Encapsulate what varies
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Program to interfaces, not to implementations.
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes.

## OO Patterns
- **Singleton** - Ensure a class only has one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
