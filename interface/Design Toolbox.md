## OO Basics
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance

## OO Principles
- Encapsulate what varies.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Program to interfaces, not implementations.

## OO Patterns
- Strategy - defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.
