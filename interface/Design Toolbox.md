## OO Basics
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance

## OO Principles
- **Encapsulate what varies.**
- **Favor composition over inheritance.**
- **Program to interfaces, not implementations.**

## OO Patterns
- **Strategy** - defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.
