## OO Principles
- Encapsulate what varies.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Program to interfaces, not implementations.
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
- Classes should be open to extension but closed for modification.
- Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes.

## OO Patterns
- **Command** - Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
