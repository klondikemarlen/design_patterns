## (Unofficial) Head First Design Patterns - in Python!

Work in progress that doesn't include many extra exercises.

I'm also kind of on the fence about using all the 'get'/'set' methods as you don't need them in the simplest use case in Python.

I opted to use the semi-private '_' combined with '@property' and/or 'get'/'set' where it seemed appropriate.
