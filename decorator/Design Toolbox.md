## OO Principles
- Encapsulate what varies.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Program to interfaces, not implementations.
- Strive for loosely coupled design between objects that interact.
- **Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.**

## OO Patterns
- **Decorator** - Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
