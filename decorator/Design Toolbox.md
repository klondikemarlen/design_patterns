## OO Principles
- Encapsulate what varies.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Program to interfaces, not implementations.
- Strive for loosely coupled design between objects that interact.
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## OO Patterns
- Strategy - defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently for the clients that use it.
- Observer - defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- Decorator - Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
