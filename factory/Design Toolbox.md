## OO Principles
- Encapsulate what varies.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Program to interfaces, not implementations.
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between object that interact.
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes.**

## OO Patterns
- **Abstract Factory** - Provide and interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifiying their concrete classes.
- **Factory Method** - Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to the subclass.
