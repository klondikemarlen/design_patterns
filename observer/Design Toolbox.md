## OO Principles
- Encapsulate what varies
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Program to interfaces, not implementations.
- Strive for loosely couple designs between objects that interact.

## OO Patterns
- Strategy - defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.
- Observer - defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
